# TreeArchitectureQSM
Functions to extract architectural measures from 3D models of trees based on TLS data

This repo conatins matlab functions to calculate tree architecture models from QSMs. 
If you have TLS point clouds please see https://github.com/InverseTampere/TreeQSM to build QSMs. 

Example QSMs can be found here https://github.com/TobyDJackson/WindAndTrees_FEM/tree/master/QSMs

The more interesting architectural measures in this package are: path fraction, crown asymmetry, centre of volume, 
branching order (multiple definitions), mean branching angle, sail area, mass taper exponent.
